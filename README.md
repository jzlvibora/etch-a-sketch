<b>HOW IT WORKS</b>

By default the canvas is set to have a size of 16x16 grids and active mode is random. When the user hovers over the canvas, the targeted grid will have a randomly generated background color.  

The user has an option to select the canvas size. When the grid size value is changed, it will load the canvas with the number of grids set by user.

The user has an option to select the mode he/she wants by clicking on the mode buttons. Custom sets the targeted grid's background color to the value set by user in the color picker. Classic will set it to black , eraser to none , random to random color. 

Reset button will set everything back to default.
